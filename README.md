# This is my custom void-src template repo

### As I create templates for more programs, they will be added to this repo
### I will try to keep up with updating templates as quickly as I can but be aware they may not be very current.

#### How to use
- clone this repo
- cp or mv the files into your local srcpkgs directory
    - for example my local srcpkgs dir is $HOME/.local/pkgs/void-packages/srcpkgs/
    - so if I wanted brave-browser, I would copy brave-browser to $HOME/.local/pkgs/void-packages/srcpkgs/
- run ./xbps-src pkg <packageName>
- run sudo xbps-install --repository hostdir/binpkgs <packageName>  
  
# !NOTE!
## As always, open the template file and read its contents before installing, this is a best practice for all software you aregetting from someone else. 
Always understand what is happining, what is being installed, and make sure it is what you want to do.
UNDERSTAND ALL COMMANDS AND WHAT THEY DO BEFORE RUNNING.
